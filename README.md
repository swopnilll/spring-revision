# Learning Spring Framework

Welcome to the "Spring Revision" repository! This repository is designed to facilitate your understanding of key concepts in the Spring framework. Each branch covers a specific aspect of Spring, enabling you to progress through the concepts systematically.

## How to Explore

1. **IoC Theory**: Begin by grasping the fundamental concept of Inversion of Control (IoC).
    - Branch: [a-ioc-theory](https://github.com/swopnilll/spring-revision/tree/a-ioc-theory)

2. **Tight Coupling - Part 1**: Explore the challenges posed by tightly coupled code in Spring.
    - Branch: [b-tight-coupling-1](https://github.com/swopnilll/spring-revision/tree/b-tight-coupling-1)

3. **Tight Coupling - Part 1 Solution**: Discover solutions to address the tightly coupled code problem.
    - Branch: [c-tight-coupling-1-solution](https://github.com/swopnilll/spring-revision/tree/c-tight-coupling-1-solution)

4. **Java-Based Configuration in the Spring Container**: Learn about configuring Spring using Java-based configuration.
    - Branch: [d-java-based-configuration-spring-container](https://github.com/swopnilll/spring-revision/tree/d-java-based-configuration-spring-container)

5. **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Dive into the world of Spring with annotation-based configuration.
    - Branch: [e-annotation-based-configuraton](https://github.com/swopnilll/spring-revision/tree/e-annotation-based-configuraton)
  
6. **More on Annotation**: Dive into the world of Spring with annotation-based configuration.
    - Branch: [e-annotation-based-configuraton](https://github.com/swopnilll/spring-revision/tree/f-primary-annotation)
